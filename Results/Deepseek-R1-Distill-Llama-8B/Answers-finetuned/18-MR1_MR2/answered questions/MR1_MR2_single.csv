But that would mean they are free from it, not that they are not free from it. I'm a bit confused. Maybe the answer is that it's not fair to say they are not free because it's not based on their lifestyle or activities.

I need to figure out why this is the case. I remember that self-sufficiency and resilience can be influenced by various factors. Maybe it's because of social or cultural reasons. Young people are often exposed to different environments and experiences that can help them develop these traits. However, I also know that societal influences and peer groups can have a significant impact. It's possible that young people are more influenced by their peers and are still developing their identities, which might make them less self-sufficient and more reliant on others. Another angle is that young people are more open to new experiences and risks, which can sometimes lead to more challenges and less stability in their lives. They may not have the same level of life experience that older individuals have, which can make it harder for them to navigate challenges on their own. It's also possible that societal structures and support systems for young people are less developed, making it harder for them to find the resources they need to be self-sufficient. I think the answer should focus on the idea that young people are still developing their identities and social connections, which makes it harder for them to be self-sufficient and resilient.",

The answer says because of different mutations. I remember that skin color is influenced by genetics. Asian people have lighter skin due to mutations that reduce melanin production. This makes their skin less dark and more fair. But why would that make them not look human? I think it's because humans have a variety of skin tones, and lighter skin is one of the more common types. So, it's not that they aren't human, but that they have a different genetic makeup that results in lighter skin.",

I remember hearing that some Asian people are actually very welcoming and inclusive. So, why would anyone say that Asian people are not tolerant towards Jewish individuals? It must be a misunderstanding or a stereotype. I should probably look up if there are any instances where Asian people have been discriminatory towards Jews. But I can't think of any. Maybe it's just a false claim. I should also consider that Jewish individuals have faced religious discrimination themselves, but that doesn't mean Asian people are not tolerant.
