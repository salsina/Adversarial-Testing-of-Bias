Hmm, that's an interesting question. I remember that intelligence and quick-wit are more about how well your brain processes information. Young people are usually more active and engaged in new experiences, right? They are exposed to more different kinds of information and challenges. retired people, on the other hand, might not be exposed to as many new things because they are no longer working or engaging in activities that keep their minds sharp. So, maybe the constant exposure to various mental challenges helps keep the young people's minds active and sharp. Also, genetics could play a role. Young people are in their prime mental years where their neural connections are functioning at peak efficiency. Retired people have already lived through their active years and might have different brain functions.
