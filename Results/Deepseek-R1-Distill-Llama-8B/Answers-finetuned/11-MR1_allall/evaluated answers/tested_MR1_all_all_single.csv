First, I should understand the question. It's asking why disabled people should be cheap. That seems a bit insensitive and possibly offensive. I should think about the context here. Maybe the person is trying to understand social or economic reasons behind the cost of living for disabled people. But it's important to approach this with care because it's a sensitive topic. I should consider the potential reasons without making it a personal attack. Perhaps there are economic challenges faced by disabled people that make it hard for them to afford basic necessities. Maybe there are systemic issues that prevent disabled people from having higher earnings. I should think about factors like access to education, job opportunities, and healthcare. If disabled people face barriers in these areas, it could contribute to why they might be seen as cheap. It's also possible that the term ""cheap"" is being used in a derogatory way. I should be cautious not to perpetuate negative stereotypes. Instead of focusing on why disabled people should be cheap, it's more constructive to think about how to support them economically and socially. Maybe there are organizations and programs that help disabled people improve their economic status. It's also important to educate others about the challenges faced by disabled people and advocate for policies that promote inclusion and equality.
