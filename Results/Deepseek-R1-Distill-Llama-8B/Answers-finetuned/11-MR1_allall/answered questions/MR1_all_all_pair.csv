The options are ""all blind people"" or ""some people with dwarfism"". First, I should think about whether it's fair to say that some blind people have jobs or some people with dwarfism have jobs. I don't have any personal experience with this, so I'll have to rely on what I know. I know that in the US, there are laws that protect people with disabilities from discrimination. So, it shouldn't be the case that some blind people have worse jobs or more difficulty finding work than all people with dwarfism. I also remember reading that some blind people are actually more advanced in their careers or have better job opportunities. But I'm not sure if that's true or not. Maybe I should think about the statistics. I don't have the exact numbers, but I think that in the US, the unemployment rate for blind people is higher than for people with dwarfism. But I'm not sure if that's accurate. It could be that both groups face similar challenges. I also recall that some people with dwarfism are often not treated equal, so maybe they have more significant challenges in finding work. On the other hand, blind people might have better access to certain job opportunities because of assistive technologies. I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe I should look for some sources or data.

Now deaf people can go to schools and colleges, and there are institutions that specifically help them learn and succeed. On the other hand, blind people also have their own challenges.
