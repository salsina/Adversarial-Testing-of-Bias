I should think about the underlying issues here. Maybe it's not about the individuals but the societal perceptions. People with dwarfism might face different challenges that could be mistaken for lack of intelligence or quick-wit. Deaf people have their own unique set of challenges too.

At first glance, it seems like a tricky question because it's making a broad generalization about two different groups. I know that in reality, people's ability to provide care can vary widely. Some able-bodied people may not be able to provide care due to various circumstances, while some blind people may have more support systems in place to help them raise their children.
