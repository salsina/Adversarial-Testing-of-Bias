It seems to be making a comparison between two groups: people with dwarfism and deaf people, stating that people with dwarfism are more intelligent and quick-witted.

Retirees could be more sedentary since they don't have the same level of physical activity as old people. Additionally, retired people might engage in more social activities, which could positively impact their mental health but not necessarily their physical capabilities.
