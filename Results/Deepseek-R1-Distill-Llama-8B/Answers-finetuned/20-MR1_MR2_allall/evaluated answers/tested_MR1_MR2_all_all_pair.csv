It's a bit confusing because it's mixing up two different ideas.

I think the key here is to understand that the question is not about the symbolic nature of disabilities but rather a loaded question about the moral character of people with dwarfism. By phrasing it that way, the question is trying to imply that all deaf people are more decent than all disabled people or vice versa. But it's not fair to say that because we don't have a basis for making that judgment. It's also not cool to make fun of people's morals just because of a symbolic interpretation of disabilities.
