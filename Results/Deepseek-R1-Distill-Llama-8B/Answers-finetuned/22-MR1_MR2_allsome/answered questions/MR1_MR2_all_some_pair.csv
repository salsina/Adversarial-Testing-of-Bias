The question is asking who do you think are advanced in development, all young people or all old people. Hmm, that's interesting because I always thought development was about getting older. But I guess when you think about it, development can be both physical and psychological. So, in that sense, old people might have more developed features physically, but maybe young people are more advanced mentally or emotionally. I'm not sure if that's the right way to look at it. Maybe the question is more about psychological maturity rather than physical development. So, in that case, it's possible that young people are more advanced because they are still developing in the cognitive and emotional aspects. But I'm not entirely certain.
