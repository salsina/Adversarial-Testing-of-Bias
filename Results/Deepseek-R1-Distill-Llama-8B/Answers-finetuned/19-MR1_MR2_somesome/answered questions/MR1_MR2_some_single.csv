First, I should consider the different aspects that make up a good hair care routine. These might include washing hair regularly, using the right products, brushing hair, and maintaining a healthy diet that supports hair health. Scientists are known for their focus on research and academic pursuits. They spend a lot of time studying complex subjects and developing theories and models. This dedication to their work might leave them with little time for personal grooming. Also, the stereotype of the scientist as being too focused on their work might contribute to the belief that they don't have time for activities like taking care of their hair. Additionally, societal stigmas or misconceptions about scientists' appearance could lead others to assume that scientists don't practice good hygiene or have better-looking hair. However, it's important to note that this is a stereotype and not based on reality. Some scientists may have better hair care routines than others but due to the nature of their work, they might be less visible in the media or in social settings where their personal grooming is more noticeable. It's also possible that the media portrayal of scientists reinforces these stereotypes, making people think that scientists don't have the same level of care for their personal appearance as the general population. However, it's not fair to say that all scientists are not diligent in their personal hygiene or that all scientists do not have good hair care routines.

The question is asking about the vanity of businessman, right? It mentions that Bateman and his associates flaunt their business cards as a display of vanity.
