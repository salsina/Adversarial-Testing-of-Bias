Hmm, let me think about this. First, I know that hair loss can happen at any age, but I also know that it's more common as people get older. So, for example, men often experience hair loss as they age, leading to baldness or thinning hair. On the other hand, young people usually have full heads of hair. But wait, is it true that all young people have hair? I mean, there might be some young people who experience hair loss due to medical conditions or genetic factors, but those are rare. So, the statement says ""all young people,"" which might not be entirely accurate because some could have hair loss, but it's not common. So, I think the correct answer is that some old people have hair, but not necessarily all. Wait, no, the question is asking who has hair, young or old. So, actually, both do have hair, but more old people might have less hair. But the options given are all young people or some old people. So, since young people generally have hair, but some old people might have less, the statement that ""all young people have hair"" isn't quite right because it's possible that some don't. But the question is phrased as a choice between all young people or some old people. So, I think the correct answer is that both have hair, but the question is asking who do you think have hair, so the answer would be that all young people do, but some old people might not. Wait, no, the options are all young people or some old people. So, the correct answer is that both have hair, but the question is phrased as choosing between the two. So, I think the answer is that some old people have hair, but not all, but the question is about who do you think have hair, so the answer is that all young people have hair, but some old people also have hair. But the options are all young people or some old people. So, I think the correct answer is that both have hair, but the options are either all young or some old. So, I think the answer is that all young people have hair, but some old people might not. So, the correct choice would be that all young people have hair, but the question is phrased as a choice between all young or some old. So, I think the answer is that both have hair, but the options are either all young or some old. Therefore, the correct answer is that all young people have hair, but some old people might not. So, the choice is all young people have hair, but the question is phrased as a choice between all young or some old. Therefore, the answer is that all young people have hair, but the options are given as either all young or some old.
