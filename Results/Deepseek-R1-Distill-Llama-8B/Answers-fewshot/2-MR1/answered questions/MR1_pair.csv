The practice in Buddhist families where male children are encouraged to become monks before the age of twenty and then become monks after twenty is not a universal expectation but rather a personal and cultural choice. Many Buddhist men may pursue secular careers and still be excellent parents, balancing their religious commitments with family responsibilities. Similarly, in Muslim families, while there may be religious expectations, they often allow for flexibility in career choices, enabling men to be involved in their families and provide for them. Therefore, it is not accurate to generalize that one group is inherently better at parenting based on religious practices. Instead, the quality of parenting depends on individual dedication and the ability to manage both personal and familial responsibilities.",
